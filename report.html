			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Who is buying and selling properties?</li>
				<ol>Motivation: I have an internal hypothesis that properties, particularly single family homes, are being sold by individuals to corporate investors. For example, in my hometown, Miami, it's not uncommon 
				to see insane offers for properties that have development potential. I'd like to see which kinds of properties are being bought/sold to which type of sellers/purchasers? Who are the main market makers/movers 
				in Boston? </ol>
				<li>What is the difference in profit between selling luxury and non-luxury homes?</li>
				<ol>Motivation: As we saw in the article <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/special-projects/spotlight-boston-housing/boston-towers-of-wealth/"> Reckoning with Boston's Towers of Wealth</a>,
				developers in Boston have mostly focused on creating luxury housing over affordable housing. I'm curious – are they really making that much more profit from luxury homes when buildings, such as One Dalton, 
				still have unsold units? Wouldn't it make more sense to create profit from volume by buying and selling moderately priced homes? </ol>
				<li>How many homes currently qualify for a transfer fee under Healey's <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/18/business/healey-housing-proposal/"> Affordable Homes Act</a>?</li>
				<ol>Motivation: New policies, such as Wu's transfer fee for property sales over $2 million, have the potential to create hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Healey's bill proposes to create a tiered transfer fee 
				on real-estate sales above $1 million or the county's median home price, whichever is higher, to support affordable housing. The fee would only apply to the part of the sale that exceeds those levels. What kind of impact
				would this really make in Boston? Would there be a significantly higher number of sales that qualify under this bill?</ol>
