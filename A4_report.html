				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					In my opinion, I believe people are inherently skeptical of pro-Republican claims. That's why I mindfully included the data source 
					and description provided by the assignment notes to provide credibility to the claims. In particular, I wanted to emphasize the 
					fact that the data are from an organization <i>"committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights"</i> as a way to prime 
					the viewer that the data are not from a <i>"pro-life"</i> or <i>"right-winged"</i> organization – therefore, the claims made are actually representative of
					the U.S.
				</li>
				<li>
					Given that abortion is a sensitive topic, and the fact there's a stereotype for <i>"right-winged"</i> media to make inflammatory claims, I made sure to title 
					each visualization with <i>"just the facts"</i>, avoiding direct criticisms of Democratic states or policies. 
				</li>
				<li>
					For the two bar charts, I made sure not to normalize the data by population as a way to deceptively inflate the differences between the number of abortions in 
					Republican states and the number of abortions in Democratic states. In addition, by binning Republican and Democratic states together, I was able to hide the nuance
					across abortion numbers and rates across different states, such as the fact that Texas and Florida – which were Republican states in the 2020 election – actually had 
					some of the highest numbers of abortions in the country.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the bar chart below the map, I intentionally presented data on both the state of occurrence and state of residence. This serves as a way to present the viewer that even in the 
					<i>"counter-argument"</i> case that Republican state's residents get abortions outside of their state, Republican states still have the lowest number of abortions.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the map, I deliberately showcased only the top five states with the most significant decrease in abortion rates. This was a strategic choice to draw attention 
					away from the fact that certain Republican states, like Oklahoma, experienced the largest increases in abortion rates.
				</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I think the order in which you view visualizations is extremely important in swaying opinions. This is one of the main reasons why I aimed to angle the overall visualization towards 
					<i>"digging deeper"</i> into the data and <i>"uncovering the truth"</i>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The map on the left was designed to point out the lack of normalization in the previous visual. Yet, it's quite deceptive. By including the District of Columbia, which isn't a state and 
					is too small to be discernible without interactive features, I've managed to distort the color scaling for abortion rate discrepancies. I selected a stepped color scale ranging from dark 
					grey to red, not a single-color gradient, to emphasize the Republican states with the greatest discrepancies. I've also chosen the dark red due to the association that red is bad. Choosing 
					exactly five steps was also strategic, as it underscored the Republican states' high discrepancies, while downplaying any Democratic states that also had significant discrepancies simply due
					to the bucketing.
				</li>
				<li>
					The map on the right makes a claim that is meant to get the viewer to think negatively about Republican states, even though it's not directly tied to abortion rates. Specifically, it's meant to 
					make the viewer question the validity of the data from the previous visualization by priming the question: <i>"Why are Republican states receiving so much federal funding for abortions if they have
					the lowest abortion rates?"</i> When comparing the amount of federal funding Republican states to Democratic states in this visualization, it's easy for the viewer to see the overwhelming amount of 
					Republican red on the map compared to Democratic blue.
				</li>
				<li>
					The bar chart at the bottom selectively presents the top 10 states where the highest percentage of residents sought care outside their home state. This choice is misleading as it disproportionately 
					highlights Republican states over Democratic ones, potentially overwhelming the viewer with the prevalence of Republican states. Moreover, it strategically omits the District of Columbia; while not 
					a state, it leaned Democratic in the 2020 election and had a significant 44% rate of residents seeking care elsewhere.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		Reflecting on the design process for the visualizations addressing whether Republican states have lower abortion rates compared to Democratic states, I navigated an intricate landscape of ethical considerations and design choices. The straightforward aspect was sourcing credible data, emphasizing transparency to foster trust and comprehension. However, translating complex datasets into clear, impactful visual narratives proved challenging. Balancing the need to inform without overwhelming the audience, and to persuade without bias, required meticulous attention to every design detail, from color schemes to data categorization.

		What surprised me was the profound influence of seemingly minor design decisions. For instance, choosing a color scale or framing data within specific contextual boundaries could significantly shape viewers' interpretations and conclusions. This realization deepened my understanding of "ethical analysis and visualization" as a practice that extends beyond mere accuracy. It encompasses the responsibility to present data in a way that is honest, transparent, and conducive to informed interpretation. Ethical visualization should enable viewers to engage with the data, draw their own conclusions, and recognize any potential limitations or biases in the presented analysis.

		Drawing the line between "acceptable" persuasive choices and "misleading" ones hinges on intent and impact. Acceptable persuasion guides the audience toward insights supported by data, using design elements to highlight and clarify, not to deceive or manipulate. On the other hand, misleading choices distort or obscure information, potentially leading viewers to erroneous conclusions. The ethical imperative is to empower the audience with the ability to discern and evaluate, not to direct them toward predetermined judgments. As I reflect on this process, I see ethical visualization as a dialogue between the data storyteller and the audience, one that respects the intelligence and agency of the viewer while striving to convey the narrative embedded within the data faithfully and responsibly.
