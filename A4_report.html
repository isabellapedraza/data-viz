				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					In my opinion, I believe people are inherently skeptical of pro-Republican claims. That's why I mindfully included the data source 
					and description provided by the assignment notes to provide credibility to the claims. In particular, I wanted to emphasize the 
					fact that the data are from an organization <i>"committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights"</i> as a way to prime 
					the viewer that the data are not from a <i>"pro-life"</i> or <i>"right-winged"</i> organization – therefore, the claims made are actually representative of
					the U.S.
				</li>
				<li>
					Given that abortion is a sensitive topic, and the fact there's a stereotype for <i>"right-winged"</i> media to make inflammatory claims, I made sure to title 
					each visualization with <i>"just the facts"</i>, avoiding direct criticisms of Democratic states or policies. 
				</li>
				<li>
					For the two bar charts, I made sure not to normalize the data by population as a way to deceptively inflate the differences between the number of abortions in 
					Republican states and the number of abortions in Democratic states. In addition, by binning Republican and Democratic states together, I was able to hide the nuance
					across abortion numbers and rates across different states, such as the fact that Texas and Florida – which were Republican states in the 2020 election – actually had 
					some of the highest numbers of abortions in the country.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the bar chart below the map, I intentionally presented data on both the state of occurrence and state of residence. This serves as a way to present the viewer that even in the 
					<i>"counter-argument"</i> case that Republican state's residents get abortions outside of their state, Republican states still have the lowest number of abortions.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the map, I deliberately showcased only the top five states with the most significant decrease in abortion rates. This was a strategic choice to draw attention 
					away from the fact that certain Republican states, like Oklahoma, experienced the largest increases in abortion rates.
				</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

					Deception Score: -1

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I think the order in which you view visualizations is extremely important in swaying opinions. This is one of the main reasons why I aimed to angle the overall visualization towards 
					<i>"digging deeper"</i> into the data and <i>"uncovering the truth"</i>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The map on the left was designed to point out the lack of normalization in the previous visual. Yet, it's quite deceptive. By including the District of Columbia, which isn't a state and 
					is too small to be discernible without interactive features, I've managed to distort the color scaling for abortion rate discrepancies. I selected a stepped color scale ranging from dark 
					grey to red, not a single-color gradient, to emphasize the Republican states with the greatest discrepancies. I've also chosen the dark red due to the association that red is bad. Choosing 
					exactly five steps was also strategic, as it underscored the Republican states' high discrepancies, while downplaying any Democratic states that also had significant discrepancies simply due
					to the bucketing.
				</li>
				<li>
					The map on the right makes a claim that is meant to get the viewer to think negatively about Republican states, even though it's not directly tied to abortion rates. Specifically, it's meant to 
					make the viewer question the validity of the data from the previous visualization by priming the question: <i>"Why are Republican states receiving so much federal funding for abortions if they have
					the lowest abortion rates?"</i> When comparing the amount of federal funding Republican states to Democratic states in this visualization, it's easy for the viewer to see the overwhelming amount of 
					Republican red on the map compared to Democratic blue.
				</li>
				<li>
					The bar chart at the bottom selectively presents the top 10 states where the highest percentage of residents sought care outside their home state. This choice is misleading as it disproportionately 
					highlights Republican states over Democratic ones, potentially overwhelming the viewer with the prevalence of Republican states. Moreover, it strategically omits the District of Columbia; while not 
					a state, it leaned Democratic in the 2020 election and had a significant 44% rate of residents seeking care elsewhere.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		In the design process of my visualizations comparing abortion rates in Republican versus Democratic states, the initial steps, such as sourcing credible data and committing to clarity in its presentation, were straightforward. However, the complexity emerged when translating these datasets into compelling visual narratives. For example, in the "FOR" visualization, I chose a neutral color scheme to mitigate any preconceived associations with political affiliations, aiming to present data based on its merit rather than its political context. Conversely, the "AGAINST" visualization used a more provocative color scheme to stimulate viewer engagement and critical thinking, albeit without crossing the line into manipulation.

		One specific example that underscored the nuanced power of design choices was the use of a stepped color scale in the "AGAINST" visualization. This approach was intended to highlight variances in data more starkly than a gradient scale would, emphasizing the discrepancies in abortion rates across states. However, this choice also carried the risk of overemphasizing certain data points, potentially guiding the viewer to more alarmist conclusions. This delicate balancing act between clarity and influence, information and persuasion, was a constant theme throughout the design process.

		These experiences expanded my understanding of "ethical analysis and visualization." It's not just about the accuracy of data representation but also about the integrity of its presentation. Ethical visualization should provide a clear, unbiased window into the data, allowing viewers to draw informed conclusions. For instance, while it was tempting to aggregate data in a way that might more strongly support the proposition, I consciously chose to present individual state data transparently, ensuring that viewers could see both overarching trends and state-specific details.

		In distinguishing between "acceptable" persuasion and "misleading" techniques, intent and context became my guiding principles. Acceptable persuasion uses design to enhance understanding, like employing clear legends or explanatory annotations, facilitating an informed and nuanced viewer engagement with the data. Misleading tactics, however, might include selectively omitting data points or using visual elements that unduly influence the viewer's emotions or perceptions, such as an alarmist color scheme without adequate context or justification.

		Through this reflective process, I've come to view ethical visualization as a commitment to truth and respect for the audience's intelligence and agency. It's about facilitating an informed dialogue, where design choices, from color schemes to data categorization, are made with the aim of enhancing comprehension and fostering insightful discourse, all while maintaining a steadfast commitment to objectivity and transparency.
