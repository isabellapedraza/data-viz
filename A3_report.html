			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<h3>Phase One Question:</h3>
			<p> How does the U.S. population map to the categories of man described by Oedipus to answer the <a href="https://uen.pressbooks.pub/mythologyunbound/chapter/sphinx/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20Sphinx's%20riddle,three%20feet%20in%20the%20evening%3F%E2%80%9D&text=At%20around%20this%20time%20Oedipus,The%20answer%20is%20'man'.">Sphinx's riddle</a>?</p>

					A Reflection Across the 1990s and 2000s: What percentage of the U.S. Population fits within Oedipus's 
					categories of man? 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I wanted to emphasize the "morning," "afternoon," and "evening" aspect of the riddle by mirroring the sun's movement across the horizon, such as rising in the east, 
					being in the center of the horizon at noon, and setting in the west. I also wanted to play around with the concept of a reflection as a way to make differences across the
					two decades more obvious by leveraging the human eye's perception of symmetry. 
				</li>
				<li>
					I hoped to compare, across the 1990s and 2000s, what percentage of the total population did each category (four-footed for morning, two-footed for afternoon, three-footed 
					for evening) make up. I wanted the viewer to see how the majority of the population falls within the (afternoon/two-footed) category and, how across the 1990s and 2000s,
					the evening/three-footed category has grown and the morning/four-footed category has shrunk. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Something that didn't work well is the fact that if someone glanced at this graph without reading the title, they might assume I was trying to capture the percent of the 
					day different times of the day made up. It's hard to actually conceptualize that I'm trying to connect the Sphinx's riddle and Oedipus's answer to the U.S. population. This is 
					something I want to explore in my next sketch. Something that did work well, in my opinion, is that we can immediately see the differences between the two years since the 
					graph isn't symmetrical across the two decades.  
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> 
					In this visualization, I wanted to leverage to concept of "chart junk" to help orient the viewer of the visualization on the context behind the visualization, even if they 
					hadn't read the title. I also wanted to make it more explicit what types of "people" in the U.S. population actually make up the different categories of man (four-footed for babies, 
					two-footed for adults, three-footed for seniors). 
				</li>
				<li>
					I hoped to communicate, for each category, the differences in size for the 1990s and 2000s. I also hoped to communicate visually that the categories are divided by number of "foots"
					by actually drawing out a baby that is crawling, an adult that is standing, and a senior with a cane. 
				</li>
				<li>
					One thing that didn't work out was the fact that, because there are so many more people in the two-footed category for the 2000s, it is very hard to match the values for other categories
					to the y-axis, losing precision in the visualization. In addition, because the two-footed, 2000s population is so much larger than the rest of the categories, it looks like an outlier, making
					us focus more on that specific population than the differences within categories across the different decades. One thing that did work well was contextualizing the visualization under the overall 
					question and making the visualization memorable. In the next sketch, I want to make sure I focus on highlighting category-specific differences across the two decades. In addition, I also want to 
					make sure I'm not losing precision.
				</li>
			</ul>

					Oedipus's Categories of Man: Gender Distribution for the 1990s and 2000s.  
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I realized that in my last two visualizations, I didn't explore gender. In this visualization, I hoped to explore the differences in each category in terms of gender across the 1990s and 2000s.
					I also wanted to make sure to not run into the same precision issue as the previous graph by using percentages. I also wanted to see how the visualization would change by being even more explicit
					about a category of man being four-footed, two-footed, and three-footed instead of relying on visual aids.   
				</li>
				<li>
					I hoped to communicate what percentage of men and what percentage of women made up a certain category, and the differences in the gender distribution across categories and decades. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Some things that didn't work well were that I forgot to mention we were visualizing the U.S. population. In addition, because the gender distributions were almost always 50/50 and the axis is all 
					the way at the bottom without grid lines, I had to annotate the actual percentages to not lose precision. I also do believe we did lose the context of the question without the inclusion of "chart junk."
					On top of that, because I decided to focus on gender, we lost the overall picture of the differences in size across categories and decades, meaning we aren't fully answering the question.
					Some things that did work well were the fact we were able make easier comparisons across decades within each category. As a personal goal, I'm happy that I didn't use colors to encode gender. I also 
					like how I again leveraged symmetry to highlight major differences across categories and decades. 
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Through my exploration of different designs, I realized a couple of things. First, in order to fully answer the overall question, I feel that I should to encode the decade, the percentage of the U.S. population in 
		each category, the distribution of gender within each category, and a bit of the mythological context. When comparing the three sketches, the first sketch utilized well visual metaphors of the sun's movement 
		to represent different life stages, creating an intuitive mapping of age groups to times of day. However, it lacked clarity in directly connecting these visual elements to the demographic data it aimed to represent, 
		potentially causing confusion for viewers unfamiliar with the context. The second sketch incorporated visual storytelling elements to enhance viewer engagement and context understanding, representing the life stages 
		more literally. Yet, it struggled with scale disparity, obscuring finer details in less populous categories. The third sketch introduced a gender dimension, adding depth to the analysis but simultaneously narrowing its 
		focus and losing some contextual richness. After some reflection, I realized all three visualizations share one fundamental flaw: they expect the viewer to be able to assume the actual ages behind each of the three 
		categories of man. I hope to make this more explicit in my next design. In addition, I hope to incorporate a synthesis of the three visualizations, making sure to focus on precision, fine and low grain expressiveness, 
		and context.
